# OpenThinkD3Starter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

## Getting Started
Run git clone. Create a new branch with the name of the visualization you've been assigned. Ensure all work you do is within the branch.

There is already a new component entitled new-visualization that you should complete your work within.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
